# some lua scripts (or are they? *vsauce music*)
# how to compile:
- find luac.exe in the compiler folder
- download the lua file and luac.exe (put them in the same folder)
- open the cmd where you have those 2 files downloaded
- run:
```
luac.exe -o UID.luac uid.lua
```
- replace the uid.luac file in the GC files if its needed (it probably is)
